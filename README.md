# Introduction to Differential Abundance Analysis

Here, we have a couple of notebooks designed to walk-through of compositional data analysis, and how these concepts are key for building interpretable differential abundance tools. These statistical approaches were design for applications in microbiome, metabolomics and gene expression.
